A small project to check how to work with dynamic modules

get the app from [here](https://play.google.com/apps/test/com.dynamic.dynamicmodules/12)
<br><br><br>
edit: you don't need an addicional activity in the feature-module, if you want to stick to one-activity approach in your app, you totally can do something similar to [this](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery/on-demand#access_feature_code_different_module) and just call a composable ;)
